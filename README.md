## How to use

1. Simply install the package-list.txt on a fresh Linux distribution (I use Arch, by the way).
2. Clone this directory wherever you like.
3. Navigate to the newly cloned directory.
4. Run `stow .` and 🙏... After that, just reboot your Linux distribution (a little homage to windows or mac) and enjoy!
